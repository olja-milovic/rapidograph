## Bar Chart

The Bar Chart is the first and currently the only chart available in Rapidograph.

It is designed as a composable UI component rather than a standalone visualization. The chart is rendered using HTML and
CSS and integrates naturally into layout, theming, and design systems.

## When to Use

Use the Bar Chart when:

- comparing values accross categories
- showing positive and negative values
- consistency with UI layout and theming is more important than pixel-level control

## Orientation

The Bar Chart supports both vertical and horizontal orientations.
The same dataset can be rendered in different orientations without modification.

[//]: # (Refer to Storybook for orientation examples and layout behavior.)

## Examples and API

This document intentionally does not list the full API.

For interactive examples, configuration options, and edge cases, refer to the Bar Chart stories in Storybook.
